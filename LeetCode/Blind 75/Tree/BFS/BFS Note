Any problem involving the traversal of a tree in a level-by-level order can be efficiently solved using this approach.
We will use a Queue to keep track of all the nodes of a level before we jump onto the next level. This also means that
the space complexity of the algorithm will be O(W), where ‘W’ is the maximum number of nodes on any level.

BFS General steps/Template:
1. Initialize Queue with all entry points (typically just one for Tree)
2. While queue is not empty:
    a. for each node in the queue (currently)
    b. poll out the element (add to result)
    c. expand it, offer children to the queue in order
    d. increase level


BFS problem:
-Symmetric Tree (101)
-Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal (103)
-Minimum Depth of Binary Tree (111)
-Find Largest value in each tree row (505)
-N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal (429)
