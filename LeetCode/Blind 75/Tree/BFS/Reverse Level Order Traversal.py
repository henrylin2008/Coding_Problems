# Problem Statement
#
# Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent its level-by-level traversal in reverse order, i.e.,
# the lowest level comes first. You should populate the values of all nodes in each level from left to right in
# separate sub-arrays.
#
# Example 1:
#           [[4,5,6,7],
#            [2,3],
#            [1]]
#
# Example 2:
#           [[9,10,5],
#            [7,1],
#            [12]]
