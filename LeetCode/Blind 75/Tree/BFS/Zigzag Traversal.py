# Problem Statement
#
# Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent its zigzag level order traversal. You should populate the
# values of all nodes of the first level from left to right, then right to left for the next level and keep
# alternating in the same manner for the following levels.
#
# Example 1:
#           [[1],
#            [3, 2],
#            [4, 5, 6, 7]]
#
# Example 2:
#           [[12],
#            [1, 7],
#            [9, 10, 5],
#            [17, 20]]
