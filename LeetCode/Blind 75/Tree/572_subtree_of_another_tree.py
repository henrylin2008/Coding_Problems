# 572. Subtree of Another Tree
# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/

# Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same
# structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.
#
# A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The
# tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.
#
#
# Example 1:
# Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
# Output: true
#
# Example 2:
# Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
# Output: false

#
# Constraints:
#
# The number of nodes in the root tree is in the range [1, 2000].
# The number of nodes in the subRoot tree is in the range [1, 1000].
# -104 <= root.val <= 104
# -104 <= subRoot.val <= 104
