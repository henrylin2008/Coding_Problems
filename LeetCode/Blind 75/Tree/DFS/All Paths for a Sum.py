# Problem Statement
#
# Given a binary tree and a number ‘S’, find all paths from root-to-leaf such that the sum of all the node values of
# each path equals ‘S’.
#
# Example 1:
#           1
#         /   \
#       7       9
#     /   \    /  \
#   4     5   2    7
# S: 12
# Output: [[1,7,4], [1,9,2]
# Explanation: Here are the two paths with sum '12': 1 -> 7 -> 4 and 1 -> 9 -> 2
#
# Example 2:
#           12
#         /    \
#       7        1
#     /        /   \
#    4       10     5
# S: 23
# Output: [[12, 7, 4], [12, 1, 10]]
# Explanation: Here are the two paths with sum '23': 12 -> 7 -> 4 and 12 -> 1 -> 10

#
# Solution
#
# This problem follows the Binary Tree Path Sum problem. We can follow the same DFS approach. There will be two
# differences though:
#
# Every time we find a root-to-leaf path, we will store it in a list.
# We will traverse all paths and will not stop processing after finding the first path.


class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right


def find_paths(root, required_sum):
    all_paths = []
    find_paths_recursive(root, required_sum, [], all_paths)
    return all_paths


def find_paths_recursive(current_node, required_sum, current_path, all_paths):
    if current_node is None:
        return

    # add the current node to the path
    current_path.append(current_node.val)

    # if the current node is a leaf and its value is equal to required_sum, save the
    # current path
    if current_node.val == required_sum and current_node.left is None and current_node.right is None:
        all_paths.append(list(current_path))
    else:
        # traverse the left sub-tree
        find_paths_recursive(current_node.left, required_sum - current_node.val, current_path, all_paths)
        # traverse the right sub-tree
        find_paths_recursive(current_node.right, required_sum - current_node.val, current_path, all_paths)

    # remove the current node from the path to backtrack,
    # we need to remove the current node while we are going up the recursive call stack.
    del current_path[-1]


def main():
    root = TreeNode(12)
    root.left = TreeNode(7)
    root.right = TreeNode(1)
    root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
    root.right.left = TreeNode(10)
    root.right.right = TreeNode(5)

# Time Complexity

# The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N^2), where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the
# tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once (which will take O(N)), and for every leaf node,
# we might have to store its path (by making a copy of the current path) which will take O(N).
# We can calculate a tighter time complexity of O(NlogN)O(NlogN) from the space complexity discussion below.
#
# Space Complexity
#
# If we ignore the space required for the allPaths list, the space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N)
# in the worst case. This space will be used to store the recursion stack. The worst-case will happen when the given
# tree is a linked list (i.e., every node has only one child).
#
# How can we estimate the space used for the allPaths array? Take the example of the following balanced tree:
#
#
# Here we have seven nodes (i.e., N = 7). Since, for binary trees, there exists only one path to reach any leaf node,
# we can easily say that total root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree can’t be more than the number of leaves. As we
# know that there can’t be more than (N+1)/2 leaves in a binary tree, therefore the maximum number of elements
# in allPaths will be O((N+1)/2)=O(N). Now, each of these paths can have many nodes in them. For a
# balanced binary tree (like above), each leaf node will be at maximum depth. As we know that the depth (or height)
# of a balanced binary tree is O(logN) we can say that, at the most, each path can have logNlogN nodes in it.
# This means that the total size of the allPaths list will be O(N∗logN). If the tree is not balanced,
# we will still have the same worst-case space complexity.
#
# From the above discussion, we can conclude that our algorithm’s overall space complexity is O(N*logN).
#
# Also, from the above discussion, since for each leaf node, in the worst case, we have to copy log(N) nodes to
# store its path; therefore, the time complexity of our algorithm will also be O(N*logN).


# Similar Problems
#
# Problem 1: Given a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths.
# Solution: We can follow a similar approach. We just need to remove the “check for the path sum.”
#
# Problem 2: Given a binary tree, find the root-to-leaf path with the maximum sum.
# Solution: We need to find the path with the maximum sum. As we traverse all paths, we can keep track of the path
# with the maximum sum.
