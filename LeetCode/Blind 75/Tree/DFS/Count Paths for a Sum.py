# Problem Statement
#
# Given a binary tree and a number ‘S’, find all paths in the tree such that the sum of all the node values of each
# path equals ‘S’. Please note that the paths can start or end at any node but all paths must follow direction from
# parent to child (top to bottom).
#
# Example 1:
#           1
#         /   \
#       7       9
#     /   \    /  \
#   6     5   2    3
# S: 12
# Output: 3
# Explanation: There are three paths with sum '12': 7 -> 5, 1 -> 9 -> 2, and 9 -> 3
#
# Example 2:
#           12
#         /    \
#       7        1
#     /        /   \
#    4       10     5
# S: 11
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Here are the two paths with sum '11': 7 -> 4 and 1 -> 10
#
#
# Solution
#
# This problem follows the Binary Tree Path Sum pattern. We can follow the same DFS approach. But there will be four
# differences:
#   1. We will keep track of the current path in a list which will be passed to every recursive call.
#   2. Whenever we traverse a node we will do two things:
#       - Add the current node to the current path.
#       - As we added a new node to the current path, we should find the sums of all sub-paths ending at the current
#         node. If the sum of any sub-path is equal to ‘S’ we will increment our path count.
#   3. We will traverse all paths and will not stop processing after finding the first path.
#   4. Remove the current node from the current path before returning from the function. This is needed to Backtrack
#      while we are going up the recursive call stack to process other paths.


class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right


def count_paths(root, S):
    return count_paths_recursive(root, S, [])


def count_paths_recursive(currentNode, S, currentPath):
    if currentNode is None:
        return 0

    # add the current node to the path
    currentPath.append(currentNode.val)
    pathCount, pathSum = 0, 0
    # find the sums of all sub-paths in the current path list
    for i in range(len(currentPath) - 1, -1, -1):
        pathSum += currentPath[i]
        # if the sum of any sub-path is equal to 'S' we increment our path count.
        if pathSum == S:
            pathCount += 1

    # traverse the left sub-tree
    pathCount += count_paths_recursive(currentNode.left, S, currentPath)
    # traverse the right sub-tree
    pathCount += count_paths_recursive(currentNode.right, S, currentPath)

    # remove the current node from the path to backtrack
    # we need to remove the current node while we are going up the recursive call stack
    del currentPath[-1]

    return pathCount


def main():
    root = TreeNode(12)
    root.left = TreeNode(7)
    root.right = TreeNode(1)
    root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
    root.right.left = TreeNode(10)
    root.right.right = TreeNode(5)
    print("Tree has paths: " + str(count_paths(root, 11)))

# Time Complexity
#
#
# The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N^2) in the worst case, where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the
# tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once, but for every node, we iterate the current path. The
# current path, in the worst case, can be O(N) (in the case of a skewed tree). But, if the tree is balanced, then
# the current path will be equal to the height of the tree, i.e., O(logN). So the best case of our algorithm will
# be O(NlogN).
#
# Space Complexity
#
# The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N). This space will be used to store the recursion stack.
# The worst case will happen when the given tree is a linked list (i.e., every node has only one child). We also need
# O(N) space for storing the currentPath in the worst case.
#
# Overall space complexity of our algorithm is O(N).


# A more efficient solution
#
# Can we further improve the solution?
#
# One thing we are repeating for each node is traversing the current path and seeing if any sub-path that ends at the
# current node gives us the required sum.
#
# Let’s see if we can improve this part.
#
# We can use the Prefix Sum technique to efficiently manage the path sums.
#
# Prefix Sum
#
# Let’s first understand what Prefix Sum is. For a given array, its Prefix Sum is another array where each element is
# the commutative sum of the corresponding element in the given array and all its previous elements.
#       Input Array -> a0 | a1 | a2 | a3 |
#       Prefix Sums -> a0 | a0+a1 | a0+a1+a2 | a0+a1+a2+a3 |
#
# Here is an example:
#       Input Array -> 1 | 6 | 2 | 5 |
#       Prefix Sums -> 1 | 7 | 9 | 14 |
#
# Now, let’s say we want to find all subarrays of a given array with a target sum.
#
# Let’s say our target sum is 7, and we want to find all the subarrays of the array mentioned above.
#
# We can clearly see that there are two such subarrays: 1) [1, 6], and 2) [2, 5].
#
# How can we utilize the Prefix Sum array to find these two subarrays efficiently?
#
# There are two ways Prefix Sum can help us:
#
# a) Since each element of the prefix sum array contains the cumulative sum of current and previous elements,
# therefore, whenever we see our target sum, we have found our targeted subarray. For example, since the second
# element of the prefix sum array is 7; therefore, our target subarray will be from the start of the array till the
# second element, i.e., [1, 6]
#
# (b) Secondly, the prefix sum array can also help us find our target subarray that is not starting from the first
# index.
#
# If we subtract the target sum from any element of the prefix sum array, the result will also give us our target
# subarray (if that result is present in the prefix sum array).
#
# For example, take the 4th element of the prefix sum array and subtract the target sum from it: 14 – 7 => 7
#
# Is this result (7) present in the prefix sum array? Yes, it is the second element. This means the sum from the 3rd
# element to the current element (i.e., the 4th) is also 7.
#
# Hence, our target subarray will be from the 3rd element to the current element, i.e., [2, 5].
#
# Now, let’s see how we can use prefix sum for binary trees. Take the following example:
#           1
#         /   \
#       4       6
#     /       /  \
#   5        9    2
#                 |
#                 5
#
# We can consider each path as an array and calculate its prefix sums to find any required sub-paths. In the above
# tree, the highlighted sub-paths are exactly the same as our previous array example.
