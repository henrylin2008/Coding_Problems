# Combination Sum
# https://algo.monster/problems/combination_sum

# Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique
# combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.
#
# The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the
# frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
#
# It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the
# given input.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
#
# Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
#
# Explanation: 2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
#
# 7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
#
# These are the only two combinations.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
#
# Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]
#
# Example 3:
# Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
#
# Output: []
#
# Example 4:
# Input: candidates = [1], target = 1
#
# Output: [[1]]
#
# Example 5:
# Input: candidates = [1], target = 2
#
# Output: [[1, 1]]
#
# Constrains:
#
# 1 <= candidates.length <= 30
# 1 <= candidates[i] <= 200
# All elements of candidates are distinct.
# 1 <= target <= 500

# We can try subtracting each candidate number until the remaining number is either less or equal to zero.
# State-space Tree
# candidates = [2, 3]
#                   5 (remaining num)
#             2 /       \3 (num to subtract)
#              3         2
#         2 /    \3    2/   \3
#         1      0 x  0 x    -1
#     2 /   \ 3
#     -1    -2
#
# The only problem is that we have duplicate combinations in our results.
#
# Dedup
#
# The way we dedup is to only use candidate numbers whose index in the array is >= last used number's index. In this
# example, when we are at the teal node, we don't want to look back and use any precedent candidate such as 2. This
# is because by DFS order **we already explored subtracting 2 and during that traversal we have considered using 3 (
# blue nodes) **.
# Candidates = [2, 3]
#                   5
#             2 /       \3
#              3         2
#         2 /    \3    2/   \3
#         1      0 x  0 x    -1
#     2 /   \ 3  (2,3) (3,2) ==> duplicate
#     -1    -2

# We use an additional state start_index to keep track of the position of the last used number ("start" "index"
# because it is the index you want to start building new branches from). Final tree with duplicate branch pruned.

#                   5
#             2 /       \3
#              3         2
#         2 /    \3        \3
#         1      0 x        -1
#     2 /   \ 3  (2,3)
#     -1    -2

# This idea of establishing order and pruning backward branches a is very useful de-duplication technique. You can
# also use it in two-pointer problems that has duplicate candidates.
#
# Time Complexity: O(n^target/min(candidates)). In the worse case, the state-space tree has n branches and the depth
# of the tree is at most target divided by the smallest number in candidates.
#
# Every number can be used or not used therefore leading to exponential time complexity.
