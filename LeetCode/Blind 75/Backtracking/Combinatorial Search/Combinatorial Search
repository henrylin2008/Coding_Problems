Combinatorial search == DFS on a tree

The complexity of combinatorial problems often grows rapidly with the size of the problem.


Three steps to conquer combinatorial search problems
1. Identify the state(s).
    1. What state do we need to know whether we have reached a solution (and using it to construct a solution if the
       problem asks for it)?. In the above permutation example, we need to keep track of the letters we have already
       selected when we perform DFS.
    2. What state do we need to decide which child nodes should be visited next and which ones should be pruned? In the
       above permutation example, we have to know what the letters are left that we can still use (since each letter can
       only be used once)
2. Draw the state-space tree.
    - you want to draw the tree (on a piece of paper if you have one). A small test case that's big enough to reach at
      least one solution (leaf node).
3. DFS/backtrack on the state-space tree.
    - apply the following backtracking template:
        function dfs(node, state):
            if state is a solution:
                    report(state) # e.g. add state to final result list
                    return

            for child in children:
                if child is a part of a potential solution:
                    state.add(child) # make move
                    dfs(child, state)
                    state.remove(child) # backtrack
