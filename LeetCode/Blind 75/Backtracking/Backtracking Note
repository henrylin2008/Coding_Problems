Backtrack:
1. Base Case
2. For each possibility p
    a. Memorize current state
    b. backtrack (nex_state)
    c. Restore current state



DFS/backtrack on the state-space tree.
    - apply the following backtracking template:
       function dfs(node, state):
            if state is a solution:
                    report(state) # e.g. add state to final result list
                    return

            for child in children:
                if child is a part of a potential solution:
                    state.add(child) # make move
                    dfs(child, state)
                    state.remove(child) # backtrack
