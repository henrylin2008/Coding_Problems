# Problem Statement
# Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘S,’ find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray
# whose sum is greater than or equal to ‘S’. Return 0 if no such subarray exists.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 2], S=7
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The smallest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to '7' is [5, 2].
#
# Example 2:
# Input: [2, 1, 5, 2, 8], S=7
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The smallest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to '7' is [8].
#
# Example 3:
# Input: [3, 4, 1, 1, 6], S=8
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Smallest subarrays with a sum greater than or equal to '8' are [3, 4, 1]
# or [1, 1, 6].

# Solution
#
# This problem follows the Sliding Window pattern, and we can use a similar strategy as discussed in Maximum Sum
# Subarray of Size K. There is one difference though: in this problem, the sliding window size is not fixed. Here is
# how we will solve this problem:
#   1. First, we will add-up elements from the beginning of the array until their sum becomes greater than or equal to
#      ‘S.’
#   2. These elements will constitute our sliding window. We are asked to find the smallest such window having a sum
#      greater than or equal to ‘S.’ We will remember the length of this window as the smallest window so far.
#   3. After this, we will keep adding one element in the sliding window (i.e., slide the window ahead) in a stepwise
#      fashion.
#   4. In each step, we will also try to shrink the window from the beginning. We will shrink the window until the
#      window’s sum is smaller than ‘S’ again. This is needed as we intend to find the smallest window. This shrinking
#      will also happen in multiple steps; in each step, we will do two things:
#       -Check if the current window length is the smallest so far, and if so, remember its length.
#       -Subtract the first element of the window from the running sum to shrink the sliding window.
