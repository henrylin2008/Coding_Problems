# Problem Statement
# You are visiting a farm to collect fruits. The farm has a single row of fruit trees. You will be given two baskets,
# and your goal is to pick as many fruits as possible to be placed in the given baskets.
#
# You will be given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree. The farm has the following
# restrictions:
#   1. Each basket can have only one type of fruit. There is no limit to how many fruit a basket can hold.
#   2. You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
#   3. You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from
#      a third fruit type.
# Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.

# Example 1:
# Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
# Output: 3
# Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
#
# Example 2:
# Input: Fruit = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
# Output: 5
# Explanation: We can put 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket. This can be done if we start with the
# second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
