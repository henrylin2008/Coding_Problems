# Problem Statement
# You are visiting a farm to collect fruits. The farm has a single row of fruit trees. You will be given two baskets,
# and your goal is to pick as many fruits as possible to be placed in the given baskets.
#
# You will be given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree. The farm has the following
# restrictions:
#   1. Each basket can have only one type of fruit. There is no limit to how many fruit a basket can hold.
#   2. You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
#   3. You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from
#      a third fruit type.
# Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.
