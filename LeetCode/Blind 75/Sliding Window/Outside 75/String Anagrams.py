# Problem Challenge 2: String Anagrams (hard)
# https://designgurus.org/path-player?courseid=grokking-the-coding-interview&unit=grokking-the-coding-interview_1628541063154_7Unit

# Problem Statement
#
# Given a string and a pattern, find all anagrams of the pattern in the given string.
#
# Every anagram is a permutation of a string. As we know, when we are not allowed to repeat characters while finding
# permutations of a string, we get N!N! permutations (or anagrams) of a string having NN characters. For example,
# here are the six anagrams of the string “abc”:
#   1. abc
#   2. acb
#   3. bac
#   4. bca
#   5. cab
#   6. cba
# Write a function to return a list of starting indices of the anagrams of the pattern in the given string.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: String="ppqp", Pattern="pq"
# Output: [1, 2]
# Explanation: The two anagrams of the pattern in the given string are "pq" and "qp".
#
# Example 2:
# Input: String="abbcabc", Pattern="abc"
# Output: [2, 3, 4]
# Explanation: The three anagrams of the pattern in the given string are "bca", "cab", and "abc".
