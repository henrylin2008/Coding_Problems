# Problem Statement
# Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than K distinct characters.
# You can assume that K is less than or equal to the length of the given string.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: String="araaci", K=2
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '2' distinct characters is "araa".
#
# Example 2:
# Input: String="araaci", K=1
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '1' distinct characters is "aa".
#
# Example 3:
# Input: String="cbbebi", K=3
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The longest substrings with no more than '3' distinct characters are "cbbeb" & "bbebi".
