 Bottom up DFS (general steps):
	1.	Base Case
	2.	Get return value from the child nodes (recursion)
	3.	Use the return value from the child node to solve the current problem
	4.	(optional) additional operations
	5.	return answer (for parent problem)

Top Down DFS (steps):
	1.	Base Case
	2.	Do some calculation based off the value returned from the parent node
	3.	(optional) additional operations
	4.	pass down the return value and continue recursion
