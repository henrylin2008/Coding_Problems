# Serializing and Deserializing Binary Tree
# https://algo.monster/problems/serializing_tree

# Given a binary tree, write a serialize function that converts the tree into a string and a deserialize function
# that converts a string to a binary tree. You may serialize the tree into any string representation you want as long
# as it can be deseralized.
