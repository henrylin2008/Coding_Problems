# Open the Lock
# https://algo.monster/problems/open_the_lock

# You commissioned a locksmith to craft a special combination lock for you, because you are a lich and you want to
# hide your phylactery in somewhere secure. It looks like a regular 4-digit combination lock, with each digit can be
# one of the digits from 0~9. Each digit can be turned forwards by 1 and backwards by 1, and the first and the last
# digit is connected (9 goes to 0 when moving forward, and 0 goes to 9 when moving backward). The lock starts at 0000.
#
# However, because you don't want people to find your phylactery, you have trapped certain combinations of this
# combination lock. If someone were to set the combination to a trapped combination, bad things happen to them,
# which this question would not elaborate upon.
#
# You know the combination, and you know the trapped combinations. You wonder if the lock can be opened without
# triggering the traps, and if so, how many digit changes must be made to the lock to unlock

# Input
#   -target_combo: a string representing the four digit combination to open the lock.
#   -trapped_combos: a list of strings representing the trapped combinations.

# Output
# An integer representing the number of steps it takes to open the lock, or -1 if you can't open it without
# triggering the trap.
#
# Examples
# Example 1:
# Input:
# target_combo = "0202"
# trapped_combos = ["0201","0101","0102","1212","2002"]
# Output: 6
#
# Explanation:
# 0000 -> 1000 -> 1100 -> 1200 -> 1201 -> 1202 -> 0202, a total of 6 steps.

# Constraints
# The starting combination (0000) and the final combination is not trapped because that defeats the purpose of the lock.

# Solution
# This question is a standard BFS problem, except we consider two combinations who has one digit differ by one
# "adjacent". The implementation comes easily after we defined what "adjacent" means for this question.
#
# The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of possible combinations (which is 10^4 == 10000 in this case).
