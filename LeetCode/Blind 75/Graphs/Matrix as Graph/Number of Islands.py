# Find the Number of Islands
# https://algo.monster/problems/number_of_islands

# Given a 2-dimensional matrix of values with 0 and 1, count the number of islands of 1. An island consists of all
# value 1 cells and is surrounded by either an edge or all 0 cells. A cell can only be adjacent to each other
# horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.

# Explanation
# Intuition
# The 2D grid (matrix) is a graph as discussed in the matrix as graph module. To find an island, we can do BFS/DFS on
# a node and expand our search if the neighboring cell is also 1, like how we find cells with the same color in Flood
# Fill.
#
# However, since there might be multiple islands, we have to do flood fill on every cell. Wouldn't that blow up the
# time complexity though? Remember that we store the visited cells, and we can skip cells that have already been
# visited. So overall, each cell is visited only once.
#
# Applying the BFS for matrix graph template:
#
# Time Complexity: O(r*c)
#
# Similar to before, the time complexity is equal to the size of the matrix itself in the worst case. The size of the
# matrix is denoted by the number of rows times the number of columns so therefore we have r*c nodes in our graph.
# The number of edges for a given cell is 4 (except boundary cells whose edges are < 4). And constants are dropped in
# the time complexity notation.

# Using a matrix to store the visited nodes

# You may have noticed the matrix itself is a good place to store the information of whether a cell has been visited.
# We can update the cell that has already been visited to another number like 2 to denote it's been visited. We can
# even simply update it to 0 since the island has been recorded and we can consider the visited cells simply as water.
