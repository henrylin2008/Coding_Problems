# Walls and Gates / Zombie in Matrix
# https://algo.monster/problems/walls_and_gates

# You are given an m by n grid of integers representing a map of a dungeon. In this map:
#     * -1 represents a wall or an obstacle of some kind.
#     * 0 represents a gate out of the dungeon.
#     * INF represents empty space.
#
# For this question, let INF be 2^31 - 1 == 2147483647, which is the max value of the integer type in many
# programming languages.
#
# Venturing into the dungeon is very dangerous, so you would like to know how close you are at each point in the
# dungeon to the exit. Given the map of the dungeon, return the same map, but for each empty space, that space is
# replaced by the number of steps it takes to reach any exit. If a space cannot reach the exit, that space remains INF.
#
# Note that each step, you can move horizontally or vertically, but you cannot move pass a wall or an obstacle.
#
# Input
#   -dungeon_map: a matrix of integer representing the dungeon map.
# Output
# A matrix of integer representing the dungeon map with the addition of distance to an exit for each empty space.
#
# Examples
# Example 1:
# Input:
#   dungeon_map = [
#       [INF, -1, 0, INF],
#       [INF, INF, INF, -1],
#       [INF, -1, INF, -1],
#       [0, -1, INF, INF],
#   ]
# Output: [ [3, -1, 0, 1], [2, 2, 1, -1], [1, -1, 2, -1], [0, -1, 3, 4], ]
#
# Explanation:
#
# Constraints
# 1 <= n, m <= 500

# Solution
# This is a classical breadth-first search problem, as it asks for the distance from each point to some location.
# Simply initialize the queue with a list of gate locations, and each cycle, when we process the location at the
# front of the queue, we add all the adjacent locations into the queue if their value is INF (meaning it is empty and
# unprocessed) and mark the distances on the cells by adding the value of the current cell by 1. This way each empty
# space is only in the queue once.
#
# The time complexity is O(n * m).
