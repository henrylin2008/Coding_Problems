# Matrix as Graph
# https://algo.monster/problems/matrix_as_graph

# Very often, graph problems are represented as matrices. For example:
#   - Number of Islands
#   - Knight Shortest Path
#
# A matrix translates to a graph (adjacency list):
#                                 {
# _______________________           0: [1, 3],
# |  0  |   1   |   2   |           1: [0, 2, 4],
# -----------------------           2: [1, 5],
# |  3  |   4   |   5   |   ==>     3: [0, 4, 6],
# -----------------------           4: [1, 3, 5, 7],
# |  6  |   7   |   8   |           5: [2, 4, 8],
# -----------------------           6: [3, 7],
#                                   7: [4, 6, 8],
#                                   8: [5, 7]
#                                 }
#
# When we code the problem, we have to build the graph as we go. Nodes/vertices are represented by coordinates of
# matrix entries.
#       0       1       2
#    -------------------------
#  0 |  0,0  |  0,1  |  0,2  |
#    -------------------------
#  1 |  1,0  |  1,1  |  1,2  |
#    -------------------------
#  2 |  2,0  |  2,1  |  2,2  |
#    -------------------------

# Getting neighboring node's coordinates

# The core of BFS/DFS is to add neighbors of the current vertex to a queue/stack. The get_neighbors function returns
# all 4 (or 8 if you are allowed to go diagonal) coordinates of neighboring nodes.

#
#    ------------------------
#    |       | r-1,c |       |
#    ------------------------
#    | r,c-1 |  r,c  | r,c+1 |
#    -------------------------
#    |       | r+1,c |       |
#    -------------------------

# One way to get each neighbor's coordinates is to keep each neighbor's horizontal and vertical offsets (i.e. delta)
# in a list and adding them to the each vertex's coordinates.

num_rows, num_cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])


def get_neighbors(coord):
    row, col = coord
    delta_row = [-1, 0, 1, 0]
    delta_col = [0, 1, 0, -1]
    res = []
    for i in range(len(delta_row)):
        neighbor_row = row + delta_row[i]
        neighbor_col = col + delta_col[i]
        if 0 <= neighbor_row < num_rows and 0 <= neighbor_col < num_cols:
            res.append((neighbor_row, neighbor_col))
    return res
