BFS is better for:
    - finding nodes close/closest to the root

We can implement BFS using a queue. Important things to remember:
   -We need at least one element to kick start the process
   -Right after we dequeue an element, we'd want to enqueue its children if there are any


BFS Template
from collections import deque

def bfs_by_queue(root):
    queue = deque([root]) # at least one element in the queue to kick start bfs
    while len(queue) > 0: # as long as there is an element in the queue
        node = queue.popleft() # dequeue
        for child in node.children: # enqueue children
            if OK(child): # early return if problem condition met
                return FOUND(child)
            queue.append(child)
    return NOT_FOUND
