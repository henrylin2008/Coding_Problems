# Given an (unweighted) graph, return the length of the shortest path between two nodes A and B, in terms of the number
# of edges.
#
# Input:
# graph: {
#   0: [1, 2],
#   1: [0, 2, 3],
#   2: [0, 1],
#   3: [1]
# }
# A: 0
# B: 3
#
# Output: 2

#                   A
#                   0
#               /       \
#             1    ---    2
#           /
#        B 3
