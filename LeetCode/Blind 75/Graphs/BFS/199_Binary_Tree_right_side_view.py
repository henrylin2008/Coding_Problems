# Medium

# Given the root of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes
# you can see ordered from top to bottom.

# Example 1:
#               1
#            /     \
#          2         3
#           \          \
#             5          4
# Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]
# Output: [1,3,4]
#
# Example 2:
# Input: root = [1,null,3]
# Output: [1,3]
#
# Example 3:
# Input: root = []
# Output: []

# Constraints:
#
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
