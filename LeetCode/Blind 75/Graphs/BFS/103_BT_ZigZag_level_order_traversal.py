# Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to
# right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

# For example:
#               1          -------- Level 0         [ [1],
#             /   \
#            2     3       -------- Level 1           [3, 2],
#          /  \      \
#         4     5     6    -------- Level 2           [4, 5, 6],
#          \     \
#           7     8        -------- Level 3           [8, 7] ]

# Example 2:
# Input: root = [1]
# Output: [[1]]
#
# Example 3:
# Input: root = []
# Output: []
