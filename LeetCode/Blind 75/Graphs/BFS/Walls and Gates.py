# Walls and Gates / Zombie in Matrix
# https://algo.monster/problems/walls_and_gates

# ou are given an m by n grid of integers representing a map of a dungeon. In this map:
#   *-1 represents a wall or an obstacle of some kind.
#   *0 represents a gate out of the dungeon.
#   *INF represents empty space.
#
# For this question, let INF be 2^31 - 1 == 2147483647, which is the max value of the integer type in many programming
# languages.
#
# Venturing into the dungeon is very dangerous, so you would like to know how close you are at each point in the
# dungeon to the exit. Given the map of the dungeon, return the same map, but for each empty space, that space is
# replaced by the number of steps it takes to reach any exit. If a space cannot reach the exit, that space remains INF.
#
# Note that each step, you can move horizontally or vertically, but you cannot move pass a wall or an obstacle.
#
# Input
# dungeon_map: a matrix of integer representing the dungeon map.
# Output
# A matrix of integer representing the dungeon map with the addition of distance to an exit for each empty space.
#
# Examples
# Example 1:
# Input:
# dungeon_map = [
#   [INF, -1, 0, INF],
#   [INF, INF, INF, -1],
#   [INF, -1, INF, -1],
#   [0, -1, INF, INF],
# ]
# Output: [ [3, -1, 0, 1], [2, 2, 1, -1], [1, -1, 2, -1], [0, -1, 3, 4], ]
#
# Explanation:
#
# Constraints
# 1 <= n, m <= 500
