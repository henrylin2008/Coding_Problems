# Word Ladder is "a puzzle begins with two words, and to solve the puzzle one must find a chain of other words to
# link the two, in which two adjacent words (that is, words in successive steps) differ by one letter."
#
# For example: COLD → CORD → CARD → WARD → WARM

# Given a start word, an end word, and a list of dictionary words, determine the minimum number of steps to go from
# the start word to the end word using only words from the dictionary.
#
# Input:
# start = "COLD"
# end = "WARM"
# word_list = ["COLD", "GOLD", "CORD", "SOLD", "CARD", "WARD", "WARM", "TARD"]
#
# Output:
# 4
# Explanation: We can go from COLD to WARM by going through COLD → CORD → CARD → WARD → WARM
