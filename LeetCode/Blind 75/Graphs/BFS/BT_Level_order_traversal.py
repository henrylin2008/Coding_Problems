# Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
# https://algo.monster/problems/binary_tree_level_order_traversal

# Given a binary tree, return its level order traversal. The input is the root node of the tree. The output should be
# a list of lists of integers, with the ith list containing the values of nodes on level i, from left to right.
#
# For example:
#               1          -------- Level 0         [ [1],
#             /   \
#            2     3       -------- Level 1           [2, 3],
#          /  \      \
#         4     5     6    -------- Level 2           [4, 5, 6],
#          \
#           7              -------- Level 3           [7] ]
