# Middle of a Linked List
# https://algo.monster/problems/middle_of_linked_list

# Find the middle node of a linked list.
#
# Input: 0 1 2 3 4
#
# Output: 2
#
# If the number of nodes is even, then return the second middle node.
#
# Input: 0 1 2 3 4 5
#
# Output: 3

# Intuition

# If it was an array, then we can get its length and middle element trivially. For a linked list, we have to traverse
# it to find its length l. We can find l by traversing the list once and then find the middle element by traversing
# it again and stop on the l/2th element.
#
# Is there any way to traverse only once? We can use two pointers
#
#   -a fast pointer that moves 2 nodes at a time and
#   -a slow pointer that moves 1 node at a time
#
# Since the speed of the fast pointer is 2x of the slow pointer, by the time the fast pointer reaches the end the
# slow pointer should be at the eexact middle of the list.
#
# Time Complexity: O(n)
#
# Technically O(n/2) but again constants are cut out from the time complexity and so we are left with just O(n).
