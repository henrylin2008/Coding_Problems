# Problem Statement
#
# Given an array with positive numbers and a positive target number, find all of its contiguous subarrays whose
# product is less than the target number.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: [2, 5, 3, 10], target=30
# Output: [2], [5], [2, 5], [3], [5, 3], [10]
# Explanation: There are six contiguous subarrays whose product is less than the target.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: [8, 2, 6, 5], target=50
# Output: [8], [2], [8, 2], [6], [2, 6], [5], [6, 5]
# Explanation: There are seven contiguous subarrays whose product is less than the target.
