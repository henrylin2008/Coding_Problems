# Problem Statement
#
# Given an array of sorted numbers, remove all duplicate number instances from it in-place, such that each element
# appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same and you should not use any extra
# space so that that the solution have a space complexity of O(1).
#
# Move all the unique elements at the beginning of the array and after moving return the length of the subarray that
# has no duplicate in it.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 9, 9]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The first four elements after removing the duplicates will be [2, 3, 6, 9].
#
# Example 2:
# Input: [2, 2, 2, 11]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The first two elements after removing the duplicates will be [2, 11].
