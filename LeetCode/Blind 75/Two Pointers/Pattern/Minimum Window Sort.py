# Problem Statement

# Given an array, find the length of the smallest subarray in it which when sorted will sort the whole array.
# Example 1:
# Input: [1, 2, 5, 3, 7, 10, 9, 12]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: We need to sort only the subarray [5, 3, 7, 10, 9] to make the whole array sorted
#
# Example 2:
# Input: [1, 3, 2, 0, -1, 7, 10]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: We need to sort only the subarray [1, 3, 2, 0, -1] to make the whole array sorted
#
# Example 3:
# Input: [1, 2, 3]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The array is already sorted
#
# Example 4:
# Input: [3, 2, 1]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The whole array needs to be sorted.
