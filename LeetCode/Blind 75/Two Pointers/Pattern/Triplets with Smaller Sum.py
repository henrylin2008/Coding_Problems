# Problem Statement
#
# Given an array arr of unsorted numbers and a target sum, count all triplets in it such that arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[
# k] < target where i, j, and k are three different indices. Write a function to return the count of such triplets.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [-1, 0, 2, 3], target=3
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are two triplets whose sum is less than the target: [-1, 0, 3], [-1, 0, 2]

# Example 2:
#
# Input: [-1, 4, 2, 1, 3], target=5
# Output: 4
# Explanation: There are four triplets whose sum is less than the target:
#    [-1, 1, 4], [-1, 1, 3], [-1, 1, 2], [-1, 2, 3]
