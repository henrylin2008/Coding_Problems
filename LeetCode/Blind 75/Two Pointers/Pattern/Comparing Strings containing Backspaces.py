# Problem Statement
#
# Given two strings containing backspaces (identified by the character ‘#’), check if the two strings are equal.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: str1="xy#z", str2="xzz#"
# Output: true
# Explanation: After applying backspaces the strings become "xz" and "xz" respectively.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: str1="xy#z", str2="xyz#"
# Output: false
# Explanation: After applying backspaces the strings become "xz" and "xy" respectively.
#
# Example 3:
# Input: str1="xp#", str2="xyz##"
# Output: true
# Explanation: After applying backspaces the strings become "x" and "x" respectively.
# In "xyz##", the first '#' removes the character 'z' and the second '#' removes the character 'y'.
#
# Example 4:
# Input: str1="xywrrmp", str2="xywrrmu#p"
# Output: true
# Explanation: After applying backspaces the strings become "xywrrmp" and "xywrrmp" respectively.
