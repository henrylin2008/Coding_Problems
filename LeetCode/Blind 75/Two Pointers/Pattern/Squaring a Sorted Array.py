# Problem Statement
#
# Given a sorted array, create a new array containing squares of all the numbers of the input array in the sorted order.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [-2, -1, 0, 2, 3]
# Output: [0, 1, 4, 4, 9]
#
# Example 2:
# Input: [-3, -1, 0, 1, 2]
# Output: [0, 1, 1, 4, 9]

# Solution
#
# This is a straightforward question. The only trick is that we can have negative numbers in the input array,
# which will make it a bit difficult to generate the output array with squares in sorted order.
#
# An easier approach could be to first find the index of the first non-negative number in the array. After that,
# we can use Two Pointers to iterate the array. One pointer will move forward to iterate the non-negative numbers,
# and the other pointer will move backward to iterate the negative numbers. At any step, whichever number gives us a
# bigger square will be added to the output array. For the above-mentioned Example-1, we will do something like this:
#
#           Pointer 1   Pointer 2
#         < ---------  --------->
#         | -2 | -1 | 0 | 2 | 3 |

# Since the numbers at both ends can give us the largest square, an alternate approach could be to use two pointers
# starting at both ends of the input array. At any step, whichever pointer gives us the bigger square, we add it to
# the result array and move to the next/previous number according to the pointer. For the above-mentioned Example-1,
# we will do something like this:
#         Pointer 1        Pointer 2
#           |                 |
#         | -2 | -1 | 0 | 2 | 3 |
