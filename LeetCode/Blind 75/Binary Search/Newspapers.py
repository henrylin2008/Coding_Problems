# Newspapers
# Link: https://algo.monster/problems/newspapers_split

# You've begun working in the one and only Umbristan, and it is part of your job duty to organize newspapers. Every
# morning, your fellow coworkers will diligently read through the newspapers to examine its contents. It is your job
# to organize the newspapers into piles and hand them out to your coworkers to read through.
#
# Each newspaper is marked with the time it would take to read through its contents. The newspapers are carefully
# laid out in a line in a particular order that must not be broken when assigning the newspapers. You cannot pick and
# choose newspapers randomly from the line to assign to a co-worker. Instead, you must take newspapers from a
# particular subsection of the line, make a pile and give that to a co-worker.
#
# What is the minimum amount of time it would take to have your coworkers go through all the newspapers?
#
# Constraints
# 1 <= newspapers_read_times.length <= 10^5
#
# 1 <= newspapers_read_times[i] <= 10^5
#
# 1 <= num_coworkers <= 10^5
#
# Examples
# Example 1:
# Input: newspapers_read_times = [7,2,5,10,8], num_coworkers = 2
# Output: 18
# Explanation:
# Assign first 3 newspapers to one coworker then assign the rest to another. The time it takes for the first 3
# newspapers is 7 + 2 + 5 = 14 and for the last 2 is 10 + 8 = 18.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: newspapers_read_times = [2,3,5,7], num_coworkers = 3
# Output: 7
# Explanation:
# Assign [2, 3], [5], and [7] separately to workers. The minimum time is 7.
