# link: https://algo.monster/problems/min_in_rotated_sorted_array

# A sorted array of unique integers was rotated at an unknown pivot. For example, [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] becomes [30,
# 40, 50, 10, 20]. Find the index of the minimum element in this array. All the numbers are unique.
#
# Input: [30, 40, 50, 10, 20]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: the smallest element is 10 and its index is 3.
#
# Input: [3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 2]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: the smallest element is 2 and its index is 7.
