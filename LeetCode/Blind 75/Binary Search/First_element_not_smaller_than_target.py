# Given an array of integers sorted in increasing order and a target, find the index of the first element in the
# array that is larger than or equal to the target. Assume that it is guaranteed to find a satisfying number.
#
# Input:
#   arr = [1, 3, 3, 5, 8, 8, 10]
#   target = 2
# Output: 1
# Explanation: the first element larger than 2 is 3 which has index 1.
#
# Input:
#   arr = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
#   target = 6
# Output: 3
# Explanation: the first element larger than 6 is 7 which has index 3.
