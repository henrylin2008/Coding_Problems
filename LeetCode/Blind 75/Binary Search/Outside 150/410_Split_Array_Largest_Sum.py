# 410. Split Array Largest Sum
# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-largest-sum/
# Hard

# Given an array nums which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you can split the array into m
# non-empty continuous subarrays.
#
# Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], m = 2
# Output: 18
# Explanation:
# There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
# The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
# where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], m = 2
# Output: 9
#
# Example 3:
# Input: nums = [1,4,4], m = 3
# Output: 4
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
# 0 <= nums[i] <= 106
# 1 <= m <= min(50, nums.length)
