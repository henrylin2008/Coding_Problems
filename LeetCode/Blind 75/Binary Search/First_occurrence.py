# Find Element in Sorted Array with Duplicates
# https://algo.monster/problems/binary_search_duplicates

# Given a sorted array of integers and a target integer, find the first occurrence of the target and return its
# index. Return -1 if the target is not in the array.
#
# Input:
# arr = [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 10, 10, 10, 100]
# target = 3
#
# Output: 1
# Explanation: First occurrence of 3 is at index 1.
#
# Input:
# arr = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
# target = 6
#
# Output: -1
# Explanation: 6 does not exists in the array.

# Time Complexity: O(log(n))
# The problem is equivalent to finding the boundary of elements < 3 and elements >= 3. Now the problem is reduced to
# finding the first true element in a boolean array.
