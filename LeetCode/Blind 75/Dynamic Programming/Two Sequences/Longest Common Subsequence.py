# Longest Common Subsequence
# https://algo.monster/problems/longest_common_subsequence

# Given two strings word1 and word2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
#
# A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none)
# deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde"
# while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
#
# If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
#
# Example 1:
# Input:
#   word1 = "abcde"
#   word2 = "ace"
#
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# The longest common subsequence is ace and its length is 3.
#
# Example 2:
# Input:
#   word1 = "almost"
#   word2 = "algomonster"
# Output: 6
# Explanation:
# The longest common subsequence is almost and its length is 6.
#
# Example 3:
# Input:
# word1 = "abc"
# word2 = "def"
# Output: 0
# Explanation:
# There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
