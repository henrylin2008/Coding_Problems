# Minimum Cost to Visit Every Node in a Graph
# https://algo.monster/problems/min_cost_to_visit_every_node

# Output the minimum cost to traverse every node in a directed weighted graph. The graph will be in the form of a 2D
# list where element [i,j] in the array denotes the weight of the directed edge from i to j. If the value is 0 then
# the edge doesn't exist. You do not have to end at the starting node. All edges are guaranteed to be in the range [
# 0,1000], there will not exceed 15 nodes in the graph. The starting node will always be at node 0. If a solution
# does not exist return -1.
