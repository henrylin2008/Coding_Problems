Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is an algorithmic optimization technique that breaks down a complicated problem into smaller
overlapping sub-problems in a recursive manner and uses solutions to the sub-problems to construct a solution to the
original problem.

Characteristics of Dynamic Programming
A problem is a dynamic programming problem if it satisfies two conditions:
    1. The problem can be divided into sub-problems, and its optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions
       of the sub-problems. In academic terms, this is called optimal substructure.
    2. The sub-problems from 1) overlap.
