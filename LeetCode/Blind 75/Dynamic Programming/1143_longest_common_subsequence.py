# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence
# LinK: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/
# Medium

# Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common
# subsequence, return 0.
#
# A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none)
# deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
#
# For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
# A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
# Example 3:
#
# Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
# text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

# 2D grid: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
# Dynamic problem - button up
# create a 2D grip (dp), work from button up: reverse text2 and text1,
#      -if 2 characters are the same (text1[i] == text2[j]:)
#           1 + diagonal cell (dp[i+1][j+1])
#      -else:  (2 characters are not the same)
#           max(adj right cell, adj below cell)
#    return the value on the first cell
#                        j
