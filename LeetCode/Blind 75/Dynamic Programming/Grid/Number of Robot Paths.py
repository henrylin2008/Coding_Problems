# Number of Unique Paths to Go from Top Left to Bottom Right
# https://algo.monster/problems/robot_unique_path

# A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid.
#
# The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right
# corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
#
# How many possible unique paths are there?
#
# Example 1:
# Input: m = 2, n = 3
# Output: 3
#
# Explanation:
# From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
#
#   1. Right -> Right -> Down
#   2. Right -> Down -> Right
#   3. Down -> Right -> Right
#
# Example 2:
# Input: m = 5, n = 3
# Output: 15
