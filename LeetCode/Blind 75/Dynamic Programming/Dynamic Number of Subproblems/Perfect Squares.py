# Perfect Squares
# https://algo.monster/problems/perfect_squares

# Given a number that is less than 10^5 determine the smallest amount of perfect squares needed to sum to a
# particular number? The same number can be used multiple times.
#
# Examples
# Example 1:
# Input: 12
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# 12 = 4 + 4 + 4
#
# Example 2:
# Input: 13
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# 13 = 4 + 9

# Solution
# The answer is to use dynamic programming either bottom-up or top-down and to maintain the least number of numbers
# to get a certain sum. Alternatively you can use a graph theory algorithm such as bfs to solve this question as well
# using a queue. The solution displayed uses a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, the other solutions may serve
# as good practice for practicing other algorithms.

# Time Complexity: O(n*sqrt(n))
