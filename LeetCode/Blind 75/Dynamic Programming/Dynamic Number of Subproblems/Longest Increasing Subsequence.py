# Link: https://algo.monster/problems/longest_increasing_subsequence

# Input
#   nums: the integer sequence
# Output
#   the length of longest subsequence
#
# Examples
# Example 1:
# Input:
#   nums = [50, 3, 10, 7, 40, 80]
# Output: 4
#
# Explanation:
# The longest subsequence is [3, 7, 40, 80] which has length 4.
#
# Example 2:
# Input:
# nums = [1, 2, 4, 3]
# Output: 3
#
# Explanation:
# Both [1, 2, 4] and [1, 2, 3] are longest subsequences which have length 3.
