# Largest Divisible Subset
# https://algo.monster/problems/largest_divisible_subset

# You are given a set of numbers nums consisting of distinct numbers. Find the size of the largest subset that
# satisfies the following condition: for each two number pairings in the set, one number is divisible by the other.
#
# Input
#   nums: a list integers representing the set.
# Output
# An integer representing the size of the largest subset that satisfy the condition.
#
# Examples
# Example 1:
# Input:
# nums = [1, 2, 3]
# Output: 2
#
# Explanation:
# Either [1, 2] or [1, 3] satisfy the condition, because both 2 and 3 are both divisible by 1. Either way,
# the largest set has a size of 2.
#
# Example 2:
# Input:
# nums = [1, 2, 4, 8]
# Output: 4
#
# Explanation:
# In this set, for each pair of numbers, at least one is divisible by the other because they are all powers of 2. As
# such, the max subset has a size of 4, the size of the original set.
#
# Constraints
#   1 <= len(nums) <= 1000
#   1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
#   Each number in nums is unique

# Solution

# Note that divisibility is transitive. That is, if a is divisible by b and b is divisible by c, then a is divisible
# by c. Furthermore, if a is divisible by b, then a must be larger than it (or equal, but that is not relevant in
# this question as the numbers are unique).
#
# Therefore, if a set satisfies the condition, starting from the lowest number, the next smallest number must be
# divisible by the current number. This means that we can expand on the set by finding a number that is divisible by
# the largest element in the existing set.
#
# In that case, for each number in nums, consider the size of the largest set that satisfy the condition and whose
# largest element is equal to that number. It is equal to the size of the largest subset whose largest number can
# divide the current number (not including the current number) plus 1. If no such set exists, then the largest size
# is 1 because the set simply consist of the number itself (and the condition always holds true for sets with one
# element).
#
# Knowing this, we have built up a logic for a bottom-up DP: starting from the smallest number, we calculate the size
# of the largest set that satisfy the condition and whose largest number is that number using the methods above.
# Then, the size of the largest set that satisfies the condition is the max size from the numbers calculated above.
