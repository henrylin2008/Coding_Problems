# Reorganize String
# https://algo.monster/problems/reorganize_string

# Given a string s, check if the letters can be rearranged so that two characters that are adjacent to each other are
# not the same.
#
# If possible, output any possible result. If not possible, return the empty string.
#
# Example 1:
# Input:s = "aab"
# Output: aba
# Example 2:
# Input:s = "aaab"
# Output: ``
# Note:
# s will consist of lowercase letters and have length in range [1, 500].
