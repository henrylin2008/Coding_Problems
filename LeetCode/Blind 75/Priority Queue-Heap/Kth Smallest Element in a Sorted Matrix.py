# Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix
# https://algo.monster/problems/kth_smallest_element_in_a_sorted_matrix

# Given a n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns are sorted in ascending order, find the kth smallest element
# in the matrix.
#
# Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
#
# Example:
# Input:
# matrix = [
#   [ 1,  5,  9],
#   [10, 11, 13],
#   [12, 13, 15]
# ],
# k = 8,
# Output: 13
# Note:
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ n^2. You may also assume that 1 <= n <= 1000.
