# 200. Number of Islands
# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/
# Medium

# Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of
# islands.
#
# An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may
# assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: grid = [
#   ["1","1","1","1","0"],
#   ["1","1","0","1","0"],
#   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#   ["0","0","0","0","0"]
# ]
# Output: 1
# Example 2:
#
# Input: grid = [
#   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#   ["0","0","1","0","0"],
#   ["0","0","0","1","1"]
# ]
# Output: 3
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# m == grid.length
# n == grid[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 300
# grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
