# Medium

# Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.
#

# Example 1:
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
# Output: [1,2,3,5]
#
# Example 2:
# Input: head = [1], n = 1
# Output: []
#
# Example 3:
# Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
# Output: [1]
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# The number of nodes in the list is sz.
# 1 <= sz <= 30
# 0 <= Node.val <= 100
# 1 <= n <= sz
#
#
# Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?
