# Problem Statement
#
# Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a method to check if the LinkedList is a palindrome or not.
#
# Your algorithm should use constant space and the input LinkedList should be in the original form once the algorithm
# is finished. The algorithm should have O(N)O(N) time complexity where ‘N’ is the number of nodes in the LinkedList.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 4 -> 2 -> null
# Output: true
#
# Example 2:
# Input: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 4 -> 2 -> 2 -> null
# Output: false
