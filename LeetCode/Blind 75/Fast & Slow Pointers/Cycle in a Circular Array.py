# Problem Challenge 3: Cycle in a Circular Array (hard)

# Problem Statement
#
# We are given an array containing positive and negative numbers. Suppose the array contains a number ‘M’ at a
# particular index. Now, if ‘M’ is positive we will move forward ‘M’ indices and if ‘M’ is negative move backwards
# ‘M’ indices. You should assume that the array is circular which means two things:
#   1. If, while moving forward, we reach the end of the array, we will jump to the first element to continue the
#      movement.
#   2. If, while moving backward, we reach the beginning of the array, we will jump to the last element to continue the
#      movement.
#
# Write a method to determine if the array has a cycle. The cycle should have more than one element and should follow
# one direction which means the cycle should not contain both forward and backward movements.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [1, 2, -1, 2, 2]
# Output: true
# Explanation: The array has a cycle among indices: 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 0
#
# Example 2:
# Input: [2, 2, -1, 2]
# Output: true
# Explanation: The array has a cycle among indices: 1 -> 3 -> 1

# Example 3:
# Input: [2, 1, -1, -2]
# Output: false
# Explanation: The array does not have any cycle.
