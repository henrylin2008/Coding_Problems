# Problem Challenge 2: Rearrange a LinkedList (medium)
# https://designgurus.org/path-player?courseid=grokking-the-coding-interview&unit=grokking-the-coding-interview_1628743587877_18Unit

# Problem Statement
#
# Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a method to modify the LinkedList such that the nodes from the second
# half of the LinkedList are inserted alternately to the nodes from the first half in reverse order. So if the
# LinkedList has nodes 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> null, your method should return 1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4 ->
# null.
#
# Your algorithm should not use any extra space and the input LinkedList should be modified in-place.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> null
# Output: 2 -> 12 -> 4 -> 10 -> 6 -> 8 -> null
#
# Example 2:
# Input: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 10 -> null
# Output: 2 -> 10 -> 4 -> 8 -> 6 -> null

# Solution
#
# This problem shares similarities with Palindrome LinkedList. To rearrange the given LinkedList we will follow the
# following steps:
#   1. We can use the Fast & Slow pointers method similar to Middle of the LinkedList to find the middle node of the
#      LinkedList.
#   2. Once we have the middle of the LinkedList, we will reverse the second half of the LinkedList.
#   3. Finally, weâ€™ll iterate through the first half and the reversed second half to produce a LinkedList in the
#      required order.
