# 20. Valid Parentheses
# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/
# Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
#
# An input string is valid if:
#
# Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
# Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
# Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

# Example 1:
#
# Input: "()"
# Output: true
# Example 2:
#
# Input: "()[]{}"
# Output: true
# Example 3:
#
# Input: "(]"
# Output: false
# Example 4:
#
# Input: "([)]"
# Output: false
# Example 5:
#
# Input: "{[]}"
# Output: true

# case 1: ()[]{}
# case 2: ([)]
# case 3: {

# time: O(n)
# Space: O(n)
