# 88. Merge Sorted Array
# link: https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/
#
# Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.
#
# Note:
#
# The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.
# You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.
# Example:
#
# Input:
# nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
# nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3
#
# Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
#
#
def merge(nums1, m, nums2, n):
    while m > 0 and n > 0: # when there's still number in m and n
        if nums1[m-1] < nums2[n-1]: # if highest value of nums1 is less than highest value of nums 2
            nums1[m-1+n] = nums2[n-1] # move highest value of nums2 (nums2[n-1]) to the last index of nums1
            n = n - 1 # next highest value after removed n
        else:   # else if highest value of nums1 > highest value of nums2
            # swap current highest value of nums1 (nums1[m-1]) and last index (nums1[m-1+n])
            nums1[m-1+n], nums1[m-1] = nums1[m-1], nums1[m-1+n]
            m = m -1    # next (highest) value
    if m == 0 and n > 0: # when n > m, or nums2 is longer than nums1
        nums1[:n] = nums2[:n] # move everything that's left from nums2 to the beginning of nums1
    return nums1
