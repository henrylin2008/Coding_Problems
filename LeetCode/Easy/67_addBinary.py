# 67. Add Binary
# link: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary/
# Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).
#
# The input strings are both non-empty and contains only characters 1 or 0.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: a = "11", b = "1"
# Output: "100"
# Example 2:
#
# Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
# Output: "10101"
