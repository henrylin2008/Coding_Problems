# Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum
# and return its sum.
#
# Example:
#
# Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
# Output: 6
# Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
# Follow up:
#
# If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which
# is more subtle.
# Kadane's Algorithm, run O(n) time

def max_Subarray(nums):
    # initial max_current and max_global as first item in the array
    # max_current, max_global = A[0]
    # for i from 1 to length(A)-1:
    #     # max value between current index or sum of previous index and current index
    #     max_current = max(A[i], max_current + A[i])
    #     if max_current > max_global:
    #         max_global = max_current
    # return max_global

    # return max value of nums if it's < 0
    if max(nums) < 0:
        return max(nums)

    # set current max value and global max value to 0
    current_max, global_max = 0, 0

    for i in nums:
        # current max is max between 0 and current_max + i
        current_max = max(0, current_max + i)
        global_max = max(current_max, global_max)
    return global_max

# Follow-up: what if the elements can wrap around? For ex, given [8, -1, 3, 4], return 15, as we choose the numbers 3, 4,
# and 8 where teh 8 is obtained from wrapping around
# We split the follow-up problem into 2 parts. The first part is the same as before: finding the maximum subarray sum
# that doesn't wrap around. Next, we compute the maximum subarray sum that does wrap around, and take the maximum of the 2.
# To get the largest wrap-around sum, we can use a little trick. For any subarray that wraps around, there must be some
# continguous elements that are excluded, and these elements actually form the minimum possible subarray! therefore,
# we can first find the minimum subarray sum using exactly the method above, and subtract this from the array's total.
# For ex, in the example above, the minimum subarray is [-1], with a total of -1. we then subtrack this from the array
# total, 14, to get 15.
