# Validate BST
# You are given a Binary Tree data structure consisting of Binary Tree nodes. Each Binary Tree node has an integer value
# stored in a property called "value" and two children nodes stored in properties called "left" and "right," respectively.
# Children nodes can either be Binary Tree nodes themselves or the None (null) value. Write a function that returns a
# boolean representing whether or not the Binary Tree is a valid BST. A node is said to be a BST node if and only if it
# satisfies the BST property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less
# than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and both of its children nodes are either BST nodes themselves
# or None (null) values.

# hint #1:
# Every node in the BST has a maximum possible value and a minimum possible value. In other words, the value of any
# given node in the BST must be strictly smaller than some value (the value of its closest right parent) and must be
# greater than or equal to some other value (the value of its closest left parent).
#
# Hint #2:
# Validate the BST by recursively calling the validateBst function on every node, passing in the correct maximum and
# minimum possible values to each. Initialize those values to be -Infinity and +Infinity.

# Use recursive calls
# Time: O(n), n = number of nodes
# Space: O(d), d = depth of the tree
