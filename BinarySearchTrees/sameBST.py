# Same BST
# An array of integers is said to represent the Binary Search Tree (BST) obtained by inserting each integer in the array
# (from left to right) into the BST. Write a function that takes in two arrays of integers and returns a boolean
# representing whether or not these arrays represent the same BST. Note that you are not allowed to construct any BSTs in
# your code. A BST is a Binary Tree that consists only of BST nodes. A node is said to be a BST node if and only if it
# satisfies the BST property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less
# than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and both of its children nodes are either BST nodes themselves
# or None (null) values.
