# Difficulty: Very hard

# Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns an array of the same length, where each element in the
# output array corresponds to the number of integers in the input array that are to the right of the relevant index and
# that are strictly smaller than the integer at that index.
# In other words, the value at output[i] represents the number of integers that are to the right of i and that are
# strictly smaller than input[i].

# Sample Input
#   array = [8, 5, 11, -1, 3, 4, 2]

# Sample Output
# [5, 4, 4, 0, 1, 1, 0]
# There are 5 integers smaller than 8 to the right of it.
# There are 4 integers smaller than 5 to the right of it.
# There are 4 integers smaller than 11 to the right of it.
# etc..
