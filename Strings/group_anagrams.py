# Group Anagrams
# Write a function that takes in an array of strings and groups anagrams together. Anagrams are strings made up of
# exactly the same letters, where order doesn't matter. For example, "cinema" and "iceman" are anagrams; similarly,
# "foo" and "ofo" are anagrams.
# Your function should return a list fo anagram groups in no particular order.

# Sample Input:
words = ["yo", "act", "flop", "tac", "foo", "cat", "oy", "olfp"]

# Sample Output:
# [["yo", "oy"], ["flop", "olfp"], ["act", "tac", "cat"], ["foo"]]


# Solution #2
# Time: O(w * n * log(n) + n * w * log(w)); best sorting time: nlog(n); wnlog(n): w(ord) * n * log(n)
# Space: O(wn); wn + w = w*(n + 1) ==> wn
# w: # of word/strings; n: length of longest word
# solution: 2 loops; first loop sorts each string with alphabetic order; second loop sorts the index of same
# word in alphabetic order; then sort original string in alphabetic order and compare to sorted word, if they are the
# same, append to currentAnagramGroup, else append it to the result.
#  index: [ 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6,  7 ]
# loop 1: [oy, act, flop, act, foo, act, oy, flop]
#  index: [ 1 ,  3 ,  5 ,  2 ,  7  ,  4 ,  0 ,  6]
# loop 2: [act, act, act, flop, flop, foo, oy, oy]

            continue                            # exit the loop
