# Group Anagrams
# Write a function that takes in an array of strings and groups anagrams together. Anagrams are strings made up of
# exactly the same letters, where order doesn't matter. For example, "cinema" and "iceman" are anagrams; similarly,
# "foo" and "ofo" are anagrams.
# Your function should return a list fo anagram groups in no particular order.

# Sample Input:
# words = ["yo", "act", "flop", "tac", "foo", "cat", "oy", "olfp"]

# Sample Output:
# [["yo", "oy"], ["flop", "olfp"], ["act", "tac", "cat"], ["foo"]]
