# Caesar Cipher Encryptor
#
# Given a non-empty string of lowercase letters and a non-negative integer value representing a key, write a function that
# returns a new string obtained by shifting every letter in the input string by k positions in the alphabet, where k is
# the key. Note that letters should "wrap" around the alphabet; in other words, the letter "z" shifted by 1 returns the
# letter "a".

# Sample input: "xyz", 2
# Sample output: "zab"
