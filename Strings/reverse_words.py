# Reverse Words in string
# Difficulty: Medium
# Write a function that takes in a string of words separated by one or more whitespaces and returns a string that has
# these words in reverse order. For example, given the string "tim is great", your function should return "great is tim"
# For this problem, a word can contain special characters, punctuation, and numbers. The words in the string will be
# separated by one or more whitespaces, and the reversed string must contain the same whitespaces as the original
# string. For example, given the string "whitespaces    4" you would be expected to return "4    whitespaces".
# Note that you're not allowed to use any built-in split or reverse methods/functions. However, you are allowed to use
# a built-in join method/function.
# Also note that the input string isn't guaranteed to always contain words.

# Sample Input:
# string = "AlgoExpert is the best!"

# Sample Output:
# "best! the is AlgoExpert"


# Solution 1:
# Time: O(n); loop through words in the given string is O(n); loop through words/result list is also takes O(n) time
# Space: O(n); n: length of the string; keep track of length of words list, at most of length of given string
# Solution: find each word in the given string, including an empty string, then append each word into the words list;
# use a helper function to reverse each word by swapping first and last item in the list, then continue going inward
def reverseWords(string):
    words = []  # list to store all words from string, including ' '
    startOfWord = 0  # start of a word
    for idx in range(len(string)):
        character = string[idx]     # character at current index

        if character == " ":    # if current character is an empty string " "
            words.append(string[startOfWord:idx])   # add characters up to this point as a word into the words list
            startOfWord = idx   # reset starting index
        elif string[startOfWord] == " ":    # if start of word is an empty string (" ")
            words.append(" ")   # add an empty string to the words list
            startOfWord = idx   # reset starting index

    words.append(string[startOfWord:])  # add last word into the words list

    reverseList(words)   # reverse the words in words list
    return "".join(words)   # join all the words together


# function to reverse the words in a list
def reverseList(list):
    start, end = 0, len(list) - 1
    while start < end:
        list[start], list[end] = list[end], list[start]
        start += 1
        end -= 1
