# One Away Strings: https://www.udemy.com/11-essential-coding-interview-questions/learn/v4/t/quiz/379168
# Write a function that takes 2 strings and returns True if they are one away from each other
# There are one away from each other if a single operation (changing a character, deleting a character
# or adding a character) will change one of the strings to the other
# Ex: "abcde" and "abcd" are one away (delteing a character)
# "a" and "a" are one away (changing the only character 'a' to the equivalent character 'a').
# "abc" and "bcc" are NOT one away. (2 operations away)
