# Problem Statement
#
# Given the head of a LinkedList and two positions ‘p’ and ‘q’, reverse the LinkedList from position ‘p’ to ‘q’.
# Ex:
# Original List:   head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> null
#  p=2, q=4        head -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> null

# Solution
#
# The problem follows the In-place Reversal of a LinkedList pattern. We can use a similar approach as discussed in
# Reverse a LinkedList. Here are the steps we need to follow:
#   1. Skip the first p-1 nodes, to reach the node at position p.
#   2. Remember the node at position p-1 to be used later to connect with the reversed sub-list.
#   3. Next, reverse the nodes from p to q using the same approach discussed in Reverse a LinkedList.
#   4. Connect the p-1 and q+1 nodes to the reversed sub-list.

# Time Complexity
# The time complexity of our algorithm will be O(N) where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the LinkedList.
#
# Space Complexity
# We only used constant space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm is O(1).


# Similar Questions
#
# Problem 1: Reverse the first ‘k’ elements of a given LinkedList.
#
# Solution: This problem can be easily converted to our parent problem; to reverse the first ‘k’ nodes of the list,
# we need to pass p=1 and q=k.
#
# Problem 2: Given a LinkedList with ‘n’ nodes, reverse it based on its size in the following way:
#   1. If ‘n’ is even, reverse the list in a group of n/2 nodes.
#   2. If n is odd, keep the middle node as it is, reverse the first ‘n/2’ nodes and reverse the last ‘n/2’ nodes.
#
# Solution: When ‘n’ is even we can perform the following steps:
#   1. Reverse first ‘n/2’ nodes: head = reverse(head, 1, n/2)
#   2. Reverse last ‘n/2’ nodes: head = reverse(head, n/2 + 1, n)
#
# When ‘n’ is odd, our algorithm will look like:
#   1. head = reverse(head, 1, n/2)
#   2. head = reverse(head, n/2 + 2, n)
#
# Please note the function call in the second step. We’re skipping two elements as we will be skipping the middle
# element.
