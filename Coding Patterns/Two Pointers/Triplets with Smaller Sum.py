# Problem Statement
#
# Given an array arr of unsorted numbers and a target sum, count all triplets in it such that arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[
# k] < target where i, j, and k are three different indices. Write a function to return the count of such triplets.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [-1, 0, 2, 3], target=3
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are two triplets whose sum is less than the target: [-1, 0, 3], [-1, 0, 2]

# Example 2:
#
# Input: [-1, 4, 2, 1, 3], target=5
# Output: 4
# Explanation: There are four triplets whose sum is less than the target:
#    [-1, 1, 4], [-1, 1, 3], [-1, 1, 2], [-1, 2, 3]


# Solution
#
# This problem follows the Two Pointers pattern and shares similarities with Triplet Sum to Zero. The only difference
# is that, in this problem, we need to find the triplets whose sum is less than the given target. To meet the
# condition i != j != k we need to make sure that each number is not used more than once.
#
# Following a similar approach, first, we can sort the array and then iterate through it, taking one number at a
# time. Let’s say during our iteration we are at number ‘X’, so we need to find ‘Y’ and ‘Z’ such that X + Y + Z <
# targetX+Y+Z<target. At this stage, our problem translates into finding a pair whose sum is less than “target -
# Xtarget−X” (as from the above equation Y + Z == target - XY+Z==target−X). We can use a similar approach as
# discussed in Triplet Sum to Zero.


def triplet_with_smaller_sum(arr, target):
    arr.sort()
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(arr) - 2):
        count += search_pair(arr, target - arr[i], i)
    return count


def search_pair(arr, target_sum, first):
    count = 0
    left, right = first + 1, len(arr) - 1
    while (left < right):
        if arr[left] + arr[right] < target_sum:  # found the triplet
            # since arr[right] >= arr[left], therefore, we can replace arr[right] by any
            # number between left and right to get a sum less than the target sum
            count += right - left
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1  # we need a pair with a smaller sum
    return count


def main():
    print(triplet_with_smaller_sum([-1, 0, 2, 3], 3))
    print(triplet_with_smaller_sum([-1, 4, 2, 1, 3], 5))


main()


# Time Complexity
#
# Sorting the array will take O(N * logN)O(N∗logN). The searchPair() will take O(N). So, overall searchTriplets()
# will take O(N * logN + N^2), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N^2).
#
# Space Complexity
#
# The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) which is required for sorting if we are not using an
# in-place sorting algorithm.


# Similar Problems
#
# Problem: Write a function to return the list of all such triplets instead of the count. How will the time
# complexity change in this case?
#
# Solution: Following a similar approach we can create a list containing all the triplets. Here is the code - only
# the highlighted lines have changed:

def triplet_with_smaller_sum(arr, target):
    arr.sort()
    triplets = []
    for i in range(len(arr) - 2):
        search_pair(arr, target - arr[i], i, triplets)
    return triplets


def search_pair(arr, target_sum, first, triplets):
    left = first + 1
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        if arr[left] + arr[right] < target_sum:  # found the triplet
            # since arr[right] >= arr[left], therefore, we can replace arr[right] by any
            # number between left and right to get a sum less than the target sum
            for i in range(right, left, -1):
                triplets.append([arr[first], arr[left], arr[i]])
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1  # we need a pair with a smaller sum


def main():
    print(triplet_with_smaller_sum([-1, 0, 2, 3], 3))
    print(triplet_with_smaller_sum([-1, 4, 2, 1, 3], 5))


main()

# Another simpler approach could be to check every triplet of the array with three nested loops and create a list of
# triplets that meet the required condition.
#
# Time Complexity
#
# Sorting the array will take O(N * logN)O(N∗logN). The searchPair(), in this case, will take O(N^2); the main while
# loop will run in O(N) but the nested for loop can also take O(N)O(N) - this will happen when the target sum is
# bigger than every triplet in the array.
#
# So, overall searchTriplets() will take O(N * logN + N^3), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N^3)
#
# Space Complexity
#
# Ignoring the space required for the output array, the space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N)
# which is required for sorting.
