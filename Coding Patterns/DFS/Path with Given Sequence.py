# Problem Statement
#
# Given a binary tree and a number sequence, find if the sequence is present as a root-to-leaf path in the given tree.
# Example 1:
#           1
#         /   \
#       7       9
#              /  \
#             2    9
# Sequence: [1, 9, 9]
# Output: true
# Explanation: the tree has a path 1 -> 9 -> 9
#
# Example 2:
#           1
#         /    \
#       0        1
#     /        /   \
#    1        6     5
# Sequence: [1, 0, 7]
# Output: false
# Explanation: the tree does not have a path 1 -> 0 -> 7
#
# Sequence: [1, 1, 6]
# Output: true
# Explanation: the tree does not have a path 1 -> 1 -> 6

# Solution
#
# This problem follows the Binary Tree Path Sum pattern. We can follow the same DFS approach and additionally,
# track the element of the given sequence that we should match with the current node. Also, we can return false as
# soon as we find a mismatch between the sequence and the node value.

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right


def find_path(root, sequence):
    if not root:
        return len(sequence) == 0

    return find_path_recursive(root, sequence, 0)


def find_path_recursive(currentNode, sequence, sequenceIndex):
    if currentNode is None:
        return False

    seqLen = len(sequence)
    if sequenceIndex >= seqLen or currentNode.val != sequence[sequenceIndex]:
        return False

    # if the current node is a leaf, add it is the end of the sequence, we have found
    # a path!
    if currentNode.left is None and currentNode.right is None and sequenceIndex == seqLen - 1:
        return True

    # recursively call to traverse the left and right sub-tree
    # return true if any of the two recursive call return true
    return find_path_recursive(currentNode.left, sequence, sequenceIndex + 1) or \
           find_path_recursive(currentNode.right, sequence, sequenceIndex + 1)


def main():
    root = TreeNode(1)
    root.left = TreeNode(0)
    root.right = TreeNode(1)
    root.left.left = TreeNode(1)
    root.right.left = TreeNode(6)
    root.right.right = TreeNode(5)

    print("Tree has path sequence: " + str(find_path(root, [1, 0, 7])))
    print("Tree has path sequence: " + str(find_path(root, [1, 1, 6])))


main()


# Time Complexity
#
# The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N), where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is
# due to the fact that we traverse each node once.
#
# Space Complexity
#
# The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) in the worst case. This space will be used to store
# the recursion stack. The worst case will happen when the given tree is a linked list (i.e., every node has only one
# child).
