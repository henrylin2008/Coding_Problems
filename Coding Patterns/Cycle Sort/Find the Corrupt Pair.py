# Problem Statement
#
# We are given an unsorted array containing ‘n’ numbers taken from the range 1 to ‘n’. The array originally contained
# all the numbers from 1 to ‘n’, but due to a data error, one of the numbers got duplicated which also resulted in
# one number going missing. Find both these numbers.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [3, 1, 2, 5, 2]
# Output: [2, 4]
# Explanation: '2' is duplicated and '4' is missing.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: [3, 1, 2, 3, 6, 4]
# Output: [3, 5]
# Explanation: '3' is duplicated and '5' is missing.
