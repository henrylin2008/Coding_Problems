# Problem Statement
#
# Given a binary tree, return an array containing nodes in its right view. The right view of a binary tree is the set
# of nodes visible when the tree is seen from the right side.

# Example 1:
#           1
#         /   \
#       2       3
#     /   \    /  \
#   4     5   6    7
# Right view: [1, 3, 7]
#
# Example 2:
#           12
#         /    \
#       7        1
#     /        /   \
#    9       10     5
#    |
#    3
# Right view: [12, 1, 5, 3]

# Solution
#
# This problem follows the Binary Tree Level Order Traversal pattern. We can follow the same BFS approach. The only
# additional thing we will be doing is to append the last node of each level to the result array.

# Time Complexity
# The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N), where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is
# due to the fact that we traverse each node once.
#
# Space Complexity
# The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) needed for the return list. We will also need O(N)
# space for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of N/2 nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest
# level), therefore we will need O(N) space to store them in the queue.
