# Problem Statement
# Given a sorted array of numbers, find if a given number ‘key’ is present in the array. Though we know that the
# array is sorted, we don’t know if it’s sorted in ascending or descending order. You should assume that the array
# can have duplicates.
#
# Write a function to return the index of the ‘key’ if it is present in the array, otherwise return -1.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [4, 6, 10], key = 10
# Output: 2
#
# Example 2:
# Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], key = 5
# Output: 4
#
# Example 3:
# Input: [10, 6, 4], key = 10
# Output: 0
#
# Example 4:
# Input: [10, 6, 4], key = 4
# Output: 2
