# Problem Statement
#
# Find the maximum value in a given Bitonic array. An array is considered bitonic if it is monotonically increasing
# and then monotonically decreasing. Monotonically increasing or decreasing means that for any index i in the array
# arr[i] != arr[i+1].
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [1, 3, 8, 12, 4, 2]
# Output: 12
# Explanation: The maximum number in the input bitonic array is '12'.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: [3, 8, 3, 1]
# Output: 8
#
# Example 3:
# Input: [1, 3, 8, 12]
# Output: 12
#
# Example 4:
# Input: [10, 9, 8]
# Output: 10
