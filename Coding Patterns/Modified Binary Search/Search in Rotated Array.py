# Problem Statement
#
# Given an array of numbers which is sorted in ascending order and also rotated by some arbitrary number,
# find if a given ‘key’ is present in it.
#
# Write a function to return the index of the ‘key’ in the rotated array. If the ‘key’ is not present, return -1. You
# can assume that the given array does not have any duplicates.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [10, 15, 1, 3, 8], key = 15
# Output: 1
# Explanation: '15' is present in the array at index '1'.
#           Original array:     1   |   3   |   8   |   10   |   15   |
#  Array after 2 rotations:     10  |   15  |   1   |   3    |   8    |
#

# Example 2:
#
# Input: [4, 5, 7, 9, 10, -1, 2], key = 10
# Output: 4
# Explanation: '10' is present in the array at index '4'.
#           Original array:     -1   |   2   |   4   |   5   |   7   |   9   |   10   |
#  Array after 2 rotations:      4   |   5   |   7   |   9   |   10  |  -1   |    2   |

# Solution
# The problem follows the Binary Search pattern. We can use a similar approach as discussed in Order-agnostic Binary
# Search and modify it similar to Search Bitonic Array to search for the ‘key’ in the rotated array.
#
# After calculating the middle, we can compare the numbers at indices start and middle. This will give us two options:
#   1. If arr[start] <= arr[middle], the numbers from start to middle are sorted in ascending order.
#   2. Else, the numbers from middle+1 to end are sorted in ascending order.
#
# Once we know which part of the array is sorted, it is easy to adjust our ranges. For example, if option-1 is true,
# we have two choices:
#   1. By comparing the ‘key’ with the numbers at index start and middle we can easily find out if the ‘key’ lies
#      between indices start and middle; if it does, we can skip the second part => end = middle -1.
#   2. Else, we can skip the first part => start = middle + 1.

# Let’s visually see this with the above-mentioned Example-2:
#
#
# Since there are no duplicates in the given array, it is always easy to skip one part of the array in each
# iteration. However, if there are duplicates, it is not always possible to know which part is sorted. We will look
# into this case in the ‘Similar Problems’ section.

def search_rotated_array(arr, key):
    start, end = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while start <= end:
        mid = start + (end - start) // 2
        if arr[mid] == key:
            return mid

        if arr[start] <= arr[mid]:  # left side is sorted in ascending order
            if arr[start] <= key < arr[mid]:
                end = mid - 1
            else:  # key > arr[mid]
                start = mid + 1
        else:  # right side is sorted in ascending order
            if arr[mid] < key <= arr[end]:
                start = mid + 1
            else:
                end = mid - 1

    # we are not able to find the element in the given array
    return -1

# Time Complexity
# Since we are reducing the search range by half at every step, this means that the time complexity of our algorithm
# will be O(logN) where ‘N’ is the total elements in the given array.
#
# Space Complexity
# The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).

# Problem 1
# How do we search in a sorted and rotated array that also has duplicates?
# The code above will fail in the following example!
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [3, 7, 3, 3, 3], key = 7
# Output: 1
# Explanation: '7' is present in the array at index '1'.
#           Original array:     3   |   3   |   3   |   3   |   7   |
#  Array after 2 rotations:     3   |   7   |   3   |   3   |   3   |
