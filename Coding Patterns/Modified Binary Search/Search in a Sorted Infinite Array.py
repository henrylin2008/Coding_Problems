# Problem Statement
#
# Given an infinite sorted array (or an array with unknown size), find if a given number ‘key’ is present in the
# array. Write a function to return the index of the ‘key’ if it is present in the array, otherwise return -1.
#
# Since it is not possible to define an array with infinite (unknown) size, you will be provided with an interface
# ArrayReader to read elements of the array. ArrayReader.get(index) will return the number at index; if the array’s
# size is smaller than the index, it will return Integer.MAX_VALUE.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30], key = 16
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The key is present at index '6' in the array.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: [4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30], key = 11
# Output: -1
# Explanation: The key is not present in the array.
#
# Example 3:
# Input: [1, 3, 8, 10, 15], key = 15
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The key is present at index '4' in the array.
#
# Example 4:
# Input: [1, 3, 8, 10, 15], key = 200
# Output: -1
# Explanation: The key is not present in the array.

# Solution
#
# The problem follows the Binary Search pattern. Since Binary Search helps us find a number in a sorted array
# efficiently, we can use a modified version of the Binary Search to find the ‘key’ in an infinite sorted array.
#
# The only issue with applying binary search in this problem is that we don’t know the bounds of the array. To handle
# this situation, we will first find the proper bounds of the array where we can perform a binary search.
#
# An efficient way to find the proper bounds is to start at the beginning of the array with the bound’s size as ‘1’
# and exponentially increase the bound’s size (i.e., double it) until we find the bounds that can have the key.

# Once we have searchable bounds we can apply the binary search.
