# Problem Statement
# Given an array of numbers which is sorted in ascending order and is rotated ‘k’ times around a pivot, find ‘k’.
# You can assume that the array does not have any duplicates.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [10, 15, 1, 3, 8]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The array has been rotated 2 times.
#           Original array:     1   |   3   |   8   |   10   |   15   |
#  Array after 2 rotations:     10  |   15  |   1   |   3    |   8    |
#
# Example 2:
# Input: [4, 5, 7, 9, 10, -1, 2]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The array has been rotated 5 times.
#           Original array:     -1   |   2   |   4   |   5   |   7   |   9   |   10   |
#  Array after 2 rotations:      4   |   5   |   7   |   9   |   10  |  -1   |    2   |
#
# Example 3:
# Input: [1, 3, 8, 10]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The array has not been rotated.

# Solution
#
# This problem follows the Binary Search pattern. We can use a similar strategy as discussed in Search in Rotated Array.
#
# In this problem, actually, we are asked to find the index of the minimum element. The number of times the minimum
# element is moved to the right will be equal to the number of rotations. An interesting fact about the minimum
# element is that it is the only element in the given array which is smaller than its previous element. Since the
# array is sorted in ascending order, all other elements are bigger than their previous element.
#
# After calculating the middle, we can compare the number at index middle with its previous and next number. This
# will give us two options:
#   1. If arr[middle] > arr[middle + 1], then the element at middle + 1 is the smallest.
#   2. If arr[middle - 1] > arr[middle], then the element at middle is the smallest.
#
# To adjust the ranges we can follow the same approach as discussed in Search in Rotated Array. Comparing the numbers
# at indices start and middle will give us two options:
#   1. If arr[start] < arr[middle], the numbers from start to middle are sorted.
#   2. Else, the numbers from middle + 1 to end are sorted.
