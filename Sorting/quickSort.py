# QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the
# picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.
#
# Always pick first element as pivot.
# Always pick last element as pivot.
# Pick a random element as pivot.
# Pick median as pivot.
# The key process in quickSort is partition(). Target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of array as
# pivot, put x at its correct position in sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put
# all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear time.
