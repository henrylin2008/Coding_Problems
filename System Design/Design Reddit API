Design The Reddit API

Design an API for Reddit subreddits given the following information.
The API includes these 2 entities:
    * User | userId: string, ...
    * SubReddit | subredditId: string, ...


Both of these entities likely have other fields, but for the purpose of this
question, those other fields aren't needed.

Your API should support the basic functionality of a subreddit on Reddit.

Many systems design questions are intentionally left very vague and are literally given in the form of `Design Foobar`.
It's your job to ask clarifying questions to better understand the system that you have to build.

We've laid out some of these questions below; their answers should give you some guidance on the problem. Before looking
at them, we encourage you to take few minutes to think about what questions you'd ask in a real interview.
