# Lowest Common Ancestor
# Find the lowest common ancestor of two items in a binary tree.
# Assumptions:
# -Each value in the tree is unique (there are no two nodes with the same value).
# -Each node has at most two children, left and right.
# -You do not have a level attribute in each of your node (for example, 1st layer, 2nd layer, and so on).
# -Each node has pointers to left and right children, but there's no back link (a child node does not point back to its
#  parent node).
# Ex:
#   head =     5
#            /   \
#           1      4
#          / \    / \
#         3   8  9   2
#        / \
#       6   7
# LCA of 8 and 7 is 1.
# LCA of 4 and 2 is 4.

# Use this class to create binary trees.
