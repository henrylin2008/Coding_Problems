# Invert Binary Tree
# Level: Medium
# https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Invert%20Binary%20Tree
# Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and inverts it. In other words, the function should swap every left node
# in the tree for its corresponding (mirrored) right node. Each Binary Tree node has a value stored in a property called
# "value" and two children nodes stored in properties called "left" and "right," respectively. Children nodes can either
# be Binary Tree nodes themselves or the None (null) value.

# Sample Input:
#           1
#          / \
#         2   3
#        / \ / \
#       4  5 6  7
#      / \
#     8   9

# Sample Output:
#           1
#          / \
#         3   2

# Method 1: iterative | Breadth first search, go through nodes level by level, swap left and right nodes, then append it
# to the queue
# Time: O(n)
# Space: O(n)

def invertBinaryTree(tree):
    queue = [tree]  # using queue to store nodes
    while len[queue]:  # if there's still node/s in the queue
        current = queue.pop(0)  # current is first node in the queue
        if current is None:  # skip if the node is null node
            continue
        swapLeftAndRight(current)  # call helper function to swap left and right nodes
        queue.append(current.left)  # add left node to the queue
        queue.append(current.right)  # add right node to the queue


def swapLeftAndRight(tree):  # helper function that swap left and right nodes
    tree.left, tree.right = tree.right, tree.left


# Method 2: Recursive | Efficient in Space;
# Logic: start at the root node, recursive calls on invertBinaryTree for its left and right nodes
# Time: O(n); n is number of nodes
# Space: O(d): d is depth of the tree

def invertBinaryTree(tree):
    if tree is None:  # if tree is null, then skip it
        return
    swapLeftAndRight(tree)  # call helper function to swap left and right nodes
    invertBinaryTree(tree.left)  # recursive call on left side of the tree
    invertBinaryTree(tree.right)  # recursive call on right side of the tree


def swapLeftAndRight(tree):  # helper function that swap left and right nodes
    tree.left, tree.right = tree.right, tree.left
