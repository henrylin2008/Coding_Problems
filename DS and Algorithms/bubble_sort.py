# average case: O(n^2)
# worst case: O(n^2)
# Best case: O(n^2)
# Space: O(1); in-place solution (swapping nodes)

# Logic: compare 2 values side by side, move the greater value to the right side, then compare the greater value to the
# next value in the array, swap their position if the new value is less than the previous greater value; repeat the
# same process until it reaches to the end of the array.
