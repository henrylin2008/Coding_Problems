# Difficulty: Medium
# Spiral Traverse
# Write a function that takes in an n x m two-dimensional array (that can be square-shaped
# when n == m) and returns a one-dimensional array of all the array's elements in spiral order.
# spiral order starts at the top left corner of the two-dimensional array, goes to the right,
# and proceeds in a spiral pattern all the way until every element has been visited.
#
# Sample Input:
# array = [
#   [1,   2,  3, 4],
#   [12, 13, 14, 5],
#   [11, 16, 15, 6],
#   [10,  9,  8, 7],
# ]

# Sample Output:
# [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]

# Solution #1: iterative
# O(n) time | O(n) space - where n is the total number of elements in the array
# def spiralTraverse(array):
#     result = [] # Empty list
#     startRow, endRow = 0, len(array) - 1
#     startCol, endCol = 0, len(array[0]) - 1 # 0, inner array
#
#     while startRow <= endRow and startCol <= endCol:
#         for col in range(startCol, endCol + 1): # first row from the left to the right
#             result.append(array[startRow][col])
#
#         for row in range(startRow + 1, endRow + 1): # last column from second row to last row
#             result.append(array[row][endCol])
#
#         for col in reversed(range(startCol, endCol)):   # last row: from second to last column to the first column
#             # Handle the edge case when there's a single row in the middle
#             # of the matrix. In this case, we don't want to double-count the values
#             # in this row, which we've already counted in the first for loop above.
#             if startRow == endRow: #
#             avoid double-counting single row
#                 break
#             result.append(array[endRow][col])
#
#         for row in reversed(range(startRow + 1, endRow)):   # first column: from second to last row to the second row
#             # Handle the edge case when there's a single column in the middle
#             # of the matrix. In this case, we don't want to double-count the values
#             # in this column, which we've already counted in the second for loop above.
#             if startCol == endCol: # avoid double-counting single column
#                 break
#             result.append(array[row][startCol])
#
#         # pushing the boundaries inward
#         startRow += 1 # move to second row
#         endRow -= 1 # move to the row before last
#         startCol += 1   # move to second column
#         endCol -= 1 # move last column to the column before
#
#     return result
