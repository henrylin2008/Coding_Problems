# Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of
# all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
#
# For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was
# [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].
#
# Follow-up: what if you can't use division?
#
# Solution
# This problem would be easy with division: an optimal solution could just find the product of all numbers in the array
# and then divide by each of the numbers.
#
# Without division, another approach would be to first see that the ith element simply needs the product of numbers
# before i and the product of numbers after i. Then we could multiply those two numbers to get our desired product.
#
# In order to find the product of numbers before i, we can generate a list of prefix products. Specifically, the ith
# element in the list would be a product of all numbers including i. Similarly, we would generate the list of suffix
# products. Finally, for each index we can multiply the appropriate prefix and suffix values to obtain our solution.

# Time: O(n)
# Space: O(n)
# Iterating over the input arrays takes O(N) time and creating the prefix and suffix arrays take up O(N) space.

# Approach 2: O(1) space approach Although the above solution is good enough to solve the problem since we are not
# using division anymore, there's a follow-up component as well which asks us to solve this using constant space.
# Understandably so, the output array does not count towards the space complexity. This approach is essentially an
# extension of the approach above. Basically, we will be using the output array as one of L or R and we will be
# constructing the other one on the fly. Let's look at the algorithm based on this idea.
#
# Algorithm
#
# Initialize the empty answer array where for a given index i, answer[i] would contain the product of all the numbers
# to the left of i. We construct the answer array the same way we constructed the L array in the previous approach.
# These two algorithms are exactly the same except that we are trying to save up on space. The only change in this
# approach is that we don't explicitly build the R array from before. Instead, we simply use a variable to keep track
# of the running product of elements to the right and we keep updating the answer array by doing answer[i] = answer[
# i] * R answer[i]=answer[i]∗R. For a given index i, answer[i] contains the product of all the elements to the left
# and R would contain product of all the elements to the right. We then update R as R = R * nums[i]R=R∗nums[i]
# Time: O(n)
# Space: O(1)
# class Solution:
#     def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
#
#         # The length of the input array
#         length = len(nums)
#
#         # The answer array to be returned
#         answer = [0] * length
#
#         # answer[i] contains the product of all the elements to the left
#         # Note: for the element at index '0', there are no elements to the left,
#         # so the answer[0] would be 1
#         answer[0] = 1
#         for i in range(1, length):
#             # answer[i - 1] already contains the product of elements to the left of 'i - 1'
#             # Simply multiplying it with nums[i - 1] would give the product of all
#             # elements to the left of index 'i'
#             answer[i] = nums[i - 1] * answer[i - 1]
#
#         # R contains the product of all the elements to the right
#         # Note: for the element at index 'length - 1', there are no elements to the right,
#         # so the R would be 1
#         R = 1;
#         for i in reversed(range(length)):
#             # For the index 'i', R would contain the
#             # product of all elements to the right. We update R accordingly
#             answer[i] = answer[i] * R
#             R *= nums[i]
