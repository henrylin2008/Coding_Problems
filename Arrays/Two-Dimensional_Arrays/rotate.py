# Rotating a 2D array by 90 degrees
# A 2-dimensional array is an array of arrays
# Implement a function that takes a square 2D array (# columns = # rows) and rotates it by 90 degrees

# Ex:
# [[1, 2, 3],                   [[7, 4, 1],
#  [4, 5, 6],       -->          [8, 5, 2],
#  [7, 8, 9]]                    [9, 6, 3]]

# Solve this problem in place, means that your function won't create a new array to solve this problem. Instead, modify
# the content of the given array with O(1) extra space.
