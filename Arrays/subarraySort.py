# Subarray Sort
# Difficulty: Hard
# Link: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Subarray%20Sort

# Write a function that takes in an array of at least two integers and that returns an array of the starting and ending
# indices of the smallest subarray in the input array that needs to be sorted in place in order for the entire input
# array to be sorted (in ascending order).
# If the input array is already sorted, the function should return [-1, 1].

# Sample input:
# array = [1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 7, 12, 6, 7, 16, 18, 19]

# sample output:
# [3, 9]
