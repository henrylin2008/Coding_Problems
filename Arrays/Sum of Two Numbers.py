# Sum of Two Numbers
# https://binarysearch.com/problems/Sum-of-Two-Numbers
#
# Given a list of numbers nums and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k. You may not
# use the same element twice.
# Note: Numbers can be negative or 0.
# Constraints
#   n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
#
# Example 1
# Input
#   nums = [35, 8, 18, 3, 22]
#   k = 11
# Output
#   True
# Explanation
#   8 + 3 = 11
#
# Example 2
# Input
#   nums = [10, 36, 22, 14]
#   k = 4
# Output
#   False
# Explanation
#   No two numbers in this list add up to 4.
#
# Example 3
# Input
#   nums = [24, 10, 11, 4]
#   k = 15
# Output
#   True
# Explanation
#   11 + 4 = 15
#
# Example 4
# Input
#   nums = [-22, 22, -11, 11]
#   k = 0
# Output
#   True
# Explanation
#   -11 + 11 = 0
#
# Example 5
# Input
#   nums = [15, 0, 3, 2]
#   k = 15
# Output
#   True
# Explanation
#   15 + 0 = 15

# Intuition:
# The easiest way is to keep track of what you have seen previously. If you have some value x, and you've seen k-x
# before, then it must be True. Otherwise, its False.
class Solution:
    def sumTwoNums(self, nums, k):
        seen = set()    # using set for seen values
        for i in nums:
            if k - i in seen:   # if subtraction is in the seen set, return True
                return True
            seen.add(i)     # add current value into the set
        return False    # False if not in the seen set
