# Remove Islands
# Difficulty: Medium

# You're given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of potentially unequal height and width containing only 0s and 1s. The
# matrix represents a two-toned image, where each 1 represents black and each 0 represents white. An island is defined
# as any number of 1s that are horizontally or vertically adjacent (but not diagonally adjacent) and that don't touch
# the border of the image. In other words, a group of horizontally or vertically adjacent 1s isn't an island if any of
# those 1s are in the first row, last row, first column, or last column of the input matrix.
# Note that an island can twist. In other words, it doesn't have to be a straight vertical line or a straight horizontal
# line; it can be L-shaped, for example.
# You can think of islands as patches of black that don't touch the border of the two-toned image.
# Write a function that returns a modified version of the input matrix, where all of the islands are removed. You remove
# an island by replacing it with 0s.
# Naturally, you're allowed to mutate the input matrix.

# Sample Input:
# matrix =
# [
#   [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
#   [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
#   [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
#   [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
#   [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
#   [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
# ]

# Sample Output:
# [
#   [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
#   [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
#   [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
#   [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
#   [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
#   [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
# ]
# The islands that  were removed can be clearly seen here:
# [
#   [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ],
#   [ , 1,  ,  ,  ,  ],
#   [ ,  , 1,  ,  ,  ],
#   [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ],
#   [ ,  , 1, 1,  ,  ],
#   [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]
