# Depth First Search
# Difficulty: Easy

# You are given a Node class that has a name and an array of optional children Nodes. When put together, Nodes form a
# simple tree-like structure. Implement the depthFirstSearch method on the Node class, which takes in an empty array,
# traverses the tree using the Depth-first Search approach (specifically navigating the tree from left to right), stores
# all the of the Nodes' names in the input array, and returns it.
#
# Sample Input:
#  graph =      A
#            /  |  \
#          B    C    D
#         / \       /  \
#        E   F     G    H
#           / \     \
#          I   J     K
#
# Sample output:
# ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K"]


# Time: O(v+e); v: number of vertices/(nodes); e: number of edges connecting nodes
# Space: O(v); v: vertices (nodes), because of return array has length of V; or tree has one recursive branches
class Node:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.children = []
        self.name = name

    def addChild(self, name):
        self.children.append(Node(name))
        return self

    # Grab current node's name and add it to the final array; then run a for loop which runs depthFirstSearch function,
    # which it repeats the same process; lastly return the final array
    def depthFirstSearch(self, array):
        array.append(self.name)   # append node's name
        for child in self.children:  # for every child
            child.depthFirstSearch(array)  # recursive call on its children
        return array

# Its goal is to search as deeply as possible, connecting as many nodes in the graph as possible and branching
# where necessary, before backtracking.

# Time Complexity on a graph: O(V+E)
# V: Vertices
# E: Edges
####
# Time Complexity on a tree: O(V)
# V is the number of nodes
# Using a Python dictionary to act as an adjacency list

# The Algorithm
# Pick any node. If it is unvisited, mark it as visited and recur on all its adjacent nodes.
# Repeat until all the nodes are visited, or the node to be searched is found.
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}

visited = []  # Array to keep track of visited nodes.


def dfs(visited, graph, node):  # graph in the form of a dictionary, and A, which is the starting node.
    if node not in visited:  # It first checks if the current node is unvisited - if yes,
        print(node)
        visited.append(node)  # it is appended in the visited array.
        for neighbour in graph[node]:  # for each neighbor of the current node,
            dfs(visited, graph, neighbour)  # the dfs function is invoked again


# The base case is invoked when all the nodes are visited. The function then returns.
# Driver Code
dfs(visited, graph, 'A')  # 'A' is starting node

# The implementation below uses the stack data-structure to build-up and return a set of vertices that are accessible
# within the subjects connected component. Using Pythonâ€™s overloading of the subtraction operator to remove items from
# a set, we are able to add only the unvisited adjacent vertices.
# Iterative solution:

graph = {'A': set(['B', 'C']),
         'B': set(['A', 'D', 'E']),
         'C': set(['A', 'F']),
         'D': set(['B']),
         'E': set(['B', 'F']),
         'F': set(['C', 'E'])}


def dfs(graph, start):
    visited, stack = set(), [start]
    while stack:
        vertex = stack.pop()
        if vertex not in visited:
            visited.add(vertex)
            stack.extend(graph[vertex] - visited)
    return visited

# The second implementation provides the same functionality as the first, however, this time we are using the more
# succinct recursive form. Due to a common Python gotcha with default parameter values being created only once, we are
# required to create a new visited set on each user invocation. Another Python language detail is that function
# variables are passed by reference, resulting in the visited mutable set not having to reassigned upon each recursive
# call.
