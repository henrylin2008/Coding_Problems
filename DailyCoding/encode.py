# Problem
# This problem was asked by Dropbox.
#
# Spreadsheets often use this alphabetical encoding for its columns: "A", "B", "C", ..., "AA", "AB", ..., "ZZ",
# "AAA", "AAB", ....
#
# Given a column number, return its alphabetical column id. For example, given 1, return "A". Given 27, return "AA".
#
# Solution
# Let's look at some simpler cases first and see if we can find a pattern.
#
# First, what would we do if the input was between 1 and 26? In this case, we can map our input using the dictionary
# {1: "A", 2: "B", ..., 26: "Z"}.
#
# Now let's look at some two-letter solutions. What would happen if our input was between 27 and 52? In this case,
# our first letter would be "A", and our second letter would be mapped as before. What if our input was between 53
# and 78? This would be similar, except our first letter would be "B".
#
# More mathematically, for any two-letter outcome, we can perform the following steps:
#
# Floor divide n - 1 by 26
# To get the first letter, map the quotient using our dictionary
# To get the second letter, map the remainder using our dictionary
# What if the result of our floor division is greater than 26? In this case, it is impossible 
# to return a two-letter solution. Generalizing the pattern above, we can continue dividing our
# number by 26 and prepending the remainder to our solution, until we reach 0.
#
# To give an example, here is how we would deal with the input 1000:

# Divide 999 / 26 to get 38, with a remainder of 11. Solution: "L" + "".
# Divide 37 / 26 to get 1, with a remainder of 11. Solution: "L" + "L".
# Divide 1 / 26 to get 0, with a remainder of 1. Solution: "A" + "LL".
# As a result, we would return "ALL".
#
# Here's how this could look in code:

def encode(n):
    s = ""
    while n > 0:
        n, remainder = divmod(n - 1, 26)
        s = chr(65 + remainder) + s
    return s
# This solution is O(N), where N is the number of digits in our input.
