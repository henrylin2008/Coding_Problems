# Remove Duplicates From Linked List
# Difficulty: Easy

# You're given the head of a Singly Linked List whose nodes are in sorted order with respect to their values. Write a
# function that returns a modified version of the Linked List that doesn't contain any nodes with duplicate values. The
# Linked List should be modified in place (i.e., you shouldn't create a brand new list), and the modified Linked List
# should still have its nodes sorted with respect to their values.
# Each LinkedList node has an integer value as well as a next node pointing to the next node in the list or to None/null
# if it's the tail of the list.

# Sample Input:
# linkedList = 1 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 6 // the head node with value 1

# Sample Output:
# 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6  // the head node with value 1
