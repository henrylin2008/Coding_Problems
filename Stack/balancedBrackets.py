# Balanced Brackets:
# https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Balanced%20Brackets
# Difficulty: Medium
#
# Write a function that takes in a string made up brackets ((,[,{,),],and})) and other oeprational characters. The function should return
# a boolean representing wheather the string is balanced with regards to brackets.
#
# A string is said to be balanced if it has as many opening brackets or a certain type as it has closing brackets of that
# type and if no bracket is unmatched. Note that an opening bracket can't match a corresponding closing bracket that comes
# before it, and similarly, a closing bracket can't match a corresponding opening bracket that comes after it. Also, brackets
# can't overlap each other as in [(])

# Sample Input:
# string = "([])(){}(())()()"
#
# Sample Output:
# true
